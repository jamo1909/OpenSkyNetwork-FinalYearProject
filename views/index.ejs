            <p class="description">The OpenSky Network API lets you retrieve live airspace information in the form of
                state vectors
                as JSON objects giving a summary of mainly position, velocity, and identity at a certain point in time.
                The Api is available as a Rest, python or Java implementation. This project will use the API to build a
                customised version for Irish airport tracking, in particular, the arrival and departure times of
                flights. An interface displaying the data will be a key aspect of the project.</p>

                I decided that I would involve a problem that we are currently facing that involves aviation. I began to
                do research to current media about problem we currently facing in the aviation. A major topic in
                aviation at the moment is the Emissions and carbon footprint being created from aircraft and Airports. I
                then developed an idea to use the real time tracking from the OpenSky Network API and calculate the real
                time emissions and carbon footprint from planes. So, the current goal of my project is to build a
                cross-platform web app using OpenSky Network API to calculate the emissions and carbon footprint of
                aircraft and airports in real time. The project will also involve using data analytics on the real time
                data that I have collected.
