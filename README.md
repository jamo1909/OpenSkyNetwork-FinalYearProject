# OpenSkyNetworkAPI-FinalYearProject

Maynooth Final Year Project - OpenSky Network Api

## Project Outline:
The OpenSky Network API lets you retrieve live airspace information in the form of state vectors as JSON objects giving a summary of mainly position, velocity, and identity at a certain point in time. The Api is available as a Rest, python or Java implementation. This project will use the API to build a customised version for Irish airport tracking, in particular, the arrival and departure times of flights. An interface displaying the data will be a key aspect of the project.

## Project Description:
  The Real Time Aviation Emissions(RTAE) project is a project that addresses
            a problem that we are currently facing in the aviation industry. A major topic
            in the aviation industries at the moment is the emissions and carbon footprint
            being created from airports and aircraft's. This project was developed to use
            real time tracking of aircraft's using OpenSky Network API. The project also
            was developed to provide emissions and carbon footprints of Airports using Aqicn
            air quality API. This project provide data analysis on the data that it will collect
            in real time.
            This project is an ExpressJS project which is a web framework for NodeJS. This
            project incorporates technologies such as JQuery, JavaScript, EJS, LeafletJS and
            PostgreSQL.
            This project is currently a Beta version and will continue to improve. This project
            plans to be a cross-platform web application to produce an accurate real time aviation
            emissions calculation.
