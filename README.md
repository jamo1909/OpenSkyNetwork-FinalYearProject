# OpenSkyNetwork-FinalYearProject

Maynooth Final Year Project - OpenSky Network Api

## Project Description:
The OpenSky Network API lets you retrieve live airspace information in the form of state vectors as JSON objects giving a summary of mainly position, velocity, and identity at a certain point in time. The Api is available as a Rest, python or Java implementation. This project will use the API to build a customised version for Irish airport tracking, in particular, the arrival and departure times of flights. An interface displaying the data will be a key aspect of the project.
